# Sanctions Risk Dashboard

A Python-based toy analytics dashboard for monitoring and analysing economic sanctions risk exposure in financial transactions.



## Overview

This project provides a complete end-to-end solution for analysing transaction data to identify, quantify, and visualize potential sanctions compliance risks. It demonstrates key skills relevant to a Junior Risk Analyst position in economic sanctions compliance at a financial institution.
 

 ## Features

 - **Transaction Risk Flagging:** Automatically identifies transactions involving sanctioned countries or entities
 - **Advanced Risk Metrics:** Calculates Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall using multiple methodologies
 - **Interactive Data Visualization:** Provides a comprehensive dashboard with multiple views of risk exposure
 - **Filtering and Drill-Down:** Allows detailed analysis of specific countries, time periods, and transaction sizes
 - **Time-Series Analysis:** Tracks sanctions exposure trends over time
