# **Sanctions Risk Analysis Dashboard**

A Python-based toy analytics dashboard for monitoring and analysing economic sanctions risk exposure in financial transactions.


## **Overview**

This project provides a complete end-to-end solution for analysing transaction data to identify, quantify, and visualise financial risks associated with potential sanctions violations. It applies **risk scoring, penalty exposure estimation, and anomaly detection** to transactions, providing a comprehensive compliance risk report.It demonstrates key skills relevant to a Junior Risk Analyst position in economic sanctions compliance at a financial institution.



 ## **Features/Components**

 ### Transaction Data Simulation
- Synthetic transaction data creation
- **Sanctions screening** simulation
- Data cleaning and preparation

### Risk Scoring System  
- Assigns each transaction a **risk score** based on multiple factors  
- Considers **transaction amount, sanctions flags, country risk, and frequency anomalies**  
- Categorises transactions into **high, medium, and low risk groups**  

### Potential Penalty Exposure  
- Estimates **financial exposure** from potential sanctions violations  
- Inspired by **Value at Risk (VaR), but tailored for compliance risk**  
- Calculates a **Penalty at Risk (PaR)** metric, estimating the penalty amount that wonâ€™t be exceeded with 95% confidence  

<!-- ### Network Risk Analysis  
- Uses **graph theory** to detect **high-risk transaction pathways**  
- Identifies **sanctions evasion patterns** and **high-risk jurisdictions**  
- Highlights **key countries** that pose the highest network risk   -->

### Anomaly Detection  
- Uses **statistical and machine learning techniques** to identify **unusual transactions**  
- Combines **z-scores, percentiles, and clustering** for comprehensive anomaly detection  
- Flags **suspicious transactions** for further investigation  

### Comprehensive Risk Reporting  
- Generates a **detailed compliance risk report**  
- Includes **summary metrics, risk by category, country risk profiles, and time trends**  
- Identifies **highest-risk transactions** for further review

## **Technology Stack**

- **Python:** Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and numerical analysis
- **SciPy:** Statistical calculations
- **Plotly Dash:** Interactive dashboard framework
- **Plotly Express:** Data visualization

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Pipenv package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MattSelwood/sanctions-risk-dashboard.git
   cd sanctions-risk-dashboard
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install required packages with pipenv (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```

### Running the Dashboard

Execute the main Python script:
```bash
python app.py
```

The dashboard will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.


## **Future Enhancements**
- Network Risk Analysis: use **graph theory** to detect **high-risk transaction pathways** and identify **sanctions evasion patterns**.
- Enhance **machine learning anomaly detection models**.
- Incorporate **real transaction data**.
- Integrate **real sanctions list and name screening algorithm**: Implement fuzzy matching for counterparty names against real sanctions lists.
- Implement different sanctions **scenario analysis**.
